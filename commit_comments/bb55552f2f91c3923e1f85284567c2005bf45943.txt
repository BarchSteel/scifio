	body: It looks like this may be a bug in MapDB.. see https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/bb55552f2f91c3923e1f85284567c2005bf45943/scifio/src/main/java/io/scif/img/cell/cache/MapDBCache.java#L191

The "deleteFilesAfterClose()" was already being called, so perhaps it just isn't working properly..
