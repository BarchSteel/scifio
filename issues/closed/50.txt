See [this branch](https://github.com/scifio/scifio/compare/java-6) for a first cut!
doh :( I already had this conflated on https://github.com/scifio/scifio/commit/f18153826fde88aa564ef1c5090abbd714c6598f .. just hadn't split it out, since it needs to be refactored for changes to the current master.
So my branch is better because A] it's not conflated; and B] it's based off current master, right? Should we merge it?
Yep, looks good.

@ctrueden My point was that, I had also done work making a pattern to replace comments with @Overrides, so it's unfortunate that there was some repetition of work.

From now on, when we start working on an issue, especially to the point where that work lives on a branch, I think we should assign the issue to ourselves. If I had assigned this issue to myself it might have saved you some time or allowed you to work on something else. That's all
