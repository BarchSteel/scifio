title: TIFFFormat doesn't parse imagej comments correctly
body:
Reported by @dietzc 

The TIFFFormat is not using ImageJ comments properly. In a sample dataset where the first IFD does not report 3 channels but there is a "channels=3" ImageJ comment present, the resulting image has 1 channel in SCIFIO, but 3 in Bio-Formats.
