title: Refactor for N-dimensionality
body:
SCIFIO was pledged to be N-dimensional but currently is still heavily reliant upon the hard-coded 5-Disms of Bio-Formats.

Current progress:

assignee: User:hinerm
milestone: 0.7.0 - N-Dimensionality

Currently, "missing" Axes queried from a Metadata have an index of -1, and a size of 0. 

For N-dimensional computations it may be useful to return a size of 1 instead.
Note that the behavior of applying subregions to "missing" axes should be evaluated after the N-Dim refactoring.
