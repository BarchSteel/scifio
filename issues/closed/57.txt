title: Remove reader state (esp. after setting source)
body:
When setting the source on some readers (e.g. APNGReader), even though the Metadata is re-parsed, some reader state is retained (e.g. last plane opened) which prevents proper reading functionality.

This state needs to be moved either 
a) to Metadata 
b) to new classes based on the state being persisted
 or
c) add an initialization method to the Reader which clears all state and is called by setSource/setMetadata.

The simplest thing would be a), but saving read-specific metadata in Metadata makes me uncomfortable.. especially because it might limit the capacity to de-serialize Metadata... so c) may be the best thing right now.

@ctrueden do you have any thoughts/preferences here?
The problem with a) is not that the `Metadata` will have serialization problems (you can mark those fields as `transient`), but that it will limit the concurrency potential of `Metadata`. E.g., what if two readers are operating on it at the same time?

Readers, on the other hand, are already stateful. So I think c) is the best choice. However, why can't this "initialization method" simply be `super.setSource`?
@ctrueden I was thinking that since both setSource and setMetadata need to clear Reader state that another method would have to exist for each to defer to... but I forgot that setSource triggers setMetadata (if it's a different source than currently set).

So state clearing can go in setMetadata.
