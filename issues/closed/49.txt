title: Remove imglib, scifio circular dependency if possible
body:
having an imglib2 -> SCIFIO -> Imglib2-io dependency creates a circular dependency

comments:
`imglib2-io` is now obsolete. We just need to refactor some stuff in `imglib.git` to fully remove it.

However, there is still a circular dependency, in that some components of `imglib.git` make use of SCIFIO to read files, e.g. for testing purposes.

So unfortunately, it will not be possible to eliminate the circular dependency without cutting `imglib.git` in half. And I doubt the main ImgLib2 developers will want to do it.
Closing, as unnecessary.
