title: Consolidate these issues with OME trac
body:
There is probably overlap between OME trac tickets and these issues. At the least, the difference in purpose between these two tracking systems should be documented/explained.

If we're keeping SCIFIO in its own git repo and not making it a part of Bio-Formats, I think github issues should be SCIFIO-centric, while the OME trac would be used for the issues regarding the Bio-Formats fork (e.g. PFF and OME-XML conversion to SCIFIO API)

milestone: 0.7.0 - N-Dimensionality
comments:
I agree. SCIFIO-specific issues on the OME Trac should be closed with a link to the proper corresponding issue in GitHub Issues. (So any issues in Trac but not GH Issues need to be refiled here, of course.)

The OME Trac will continue to be used for tickets relating to the integration of SCIFIO with Bio-Formats, which as @hinerm says is what the [scifio/bioformats](https://github.com/scifio/bioformats) fork is all about.
Completed. The OME trac should now contain only SCIFIO tickets relevant to modifications in OME code bases. Migrated tickets to github as necessary.
