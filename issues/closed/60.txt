title: Create new Axes for use in SCIFIO
body:
see https://github.com/imagej/imglib/issues/30

We should create the Axes that are used in SCIFIO with the appropriate planar/channel/etc... flags
assignee: User:hinerm
milestone: 0.7.0 - N-Dimensionality
comments:
Note that this implies a complete refactoring of existing code to then use these axes.

We may also want to add metadata API for accessing each label of axis (e.g. instead of getAxesPlanar or getAxesNonPlanar, just getAxes(label...))
