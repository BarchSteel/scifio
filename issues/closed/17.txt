title: Use SciJava logging mechanism
body:
Right now, SCIFIO uses the old-style Bio-Formats `LOGGER` mechanism (SLF4J-based) for logging. Better would be to use the built-in SciJava `LogService`, which abstracts the source of the logging, allowing developers to purge the SLF4J dependency in favor of a simpler stderr-based solution, or to inject their own preferred logging mechanism. (There is also an [SLF4J-based `LogService` implementation](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/tree/scijava-common-1.6.1/log-slf4j/src/main/java/org/scijava/log/slf4j) available in the `scijava-common` repository, for those who want that.)

Thanks @dscho. Using your branch as a starting point, I completed this work; see 594c81aae8e796d472588bb3b9fa347cd15aa08b, as well as bd80092ccd5f4191526641e4ebfd4b1ee4cca244 and eff421792a4536530439e4f01d5ce918c9cdc0d5 for the finishing touches.

In doing this work, several helper classes were converted to proper SciJava services, so it was well worth it.
