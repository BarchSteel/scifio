title: ICSFormat metadata parsing clashes with values
body:
The ICSFormat parsing used to check each individual word in a potential key against a master list of possible values. This clashed with values that also contained these potential keys..

e.g. "history labels t x y" should be parsed as:
"history labels" : "t x y"

but because "t" is a potential key, in "parameter t", the above string is parsed:
"history labels t" : "x y"

which caused Gray ICS data to be read improperly.

This was resolved in https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/ics_fixes by parsing metadata keys in a tree fashion, where proper category hierarchies are established.
