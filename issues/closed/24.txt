title: Expand (and clean up) use of new 'setWriteSequentially' method
body:
 In loci-software:r6976, TiffWriter? was given a new method: 'void setWriteSequentially(boolean)'. The purpose of the method is to allow the calling code (e.g. ImageConverter?) to specify that it absolutely will write planes in sequential order - if setWriteSequentially(true) was called, then TiffWriter? and TiffSaver? can make certain assumptions about the planes which can speed up the export process.

In the next release, I think it would be a good idea to:

*   move 'setWriteSequentially(boolean)' to IFormatWriter
*   update loci.formats.out.*Writer and TiffSaver? to take as much advantage of this method as possible
*  add tests to verify that the resulting files are the same, regardless of what arguments are passed to setWriteSequentia
