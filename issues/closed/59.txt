title: Setting source on a filter doesn't trigger Metadata updates
body:
When setting source on a reader, a setMetadata call is magically triggered. However, Filters have no way of intercepting that setMetadata call, so their metadata remains the same.

Thus, setSource for filters is effectively broken.
