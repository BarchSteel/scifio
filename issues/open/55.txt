title: Support non-byte-aligned pixel types
body:
Many formats that we support allow non-byte pixel types (e.g. PNG and BMP supporting 1-bit, 2-bit).

Currently all of our pixel types are 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit.

To fully support these image types, we should support these additional pixel types.

Hi Mark,

on the imglib2 side Albert and me worked on a better support of those datatypes. We have a branch that we intend to merge soon.
