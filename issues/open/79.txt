title: DefaultEnabled test fails on Windows
body:
On Windows, (win 8, running mvn clean test from cygwin command line) the DefaultEnabled FilterTest fails. It seems that the annotated DefaultEnabled filter class is not discovered.

comments:
note that this only happens when compiled from the command line (e.g. mvn clean test)

If I clean on the command line and then rebuild from eclipse, the test passes. (and passes when mvn test is run from the command line)
How about adding a SCIFIO Jenkins job bound to the Windows node?
Good idea.

Given that the test is passing on windows I decided to dig a little more.
Tried using maven 2 (had been using maven 3).. same error.
Tried cleaning and testing from command line instead of cygwin.. got a whole different set of errors.

Anyway given that it's working on jenkins I'm going to stop investigating.
