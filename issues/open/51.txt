title: Make parsing cancelable
body:
Need a flag that is polled to see if another thread has canceled the parse, and abort if so.

Unfortunately that rather conflicts with the goal of issue #38: to make parsers stateless (and hence thread-safe). We'll need to choose a side of the fence, there.
I think there could be a way to do this without introducing state to the parser itself.

We could, for example, put the state in a service. e.g., ParserControlService has the flag, Parsers poll the service periodically while parsing and stop if instructed.

If the service had a single state flag that would be the simplest, but we could also have job numbers, or maps of Parser instances to an enabled/disabled flag.
