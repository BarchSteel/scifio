title: ImgSaver: add support for saving in RGB color mode
body:
It is not possible to export an image as RGB color using `ImgSaver`. The channels are always separated and saved as individual planes. It would be ideal if `ImgSaver` looked at the `ImgPlus` metadata (currently `getCompositeChannelCount()` though that API may change before the `1.0.0` release) and respected that setting to decide whether to save in RGB color mode when the format supports it.

Thanks to Colin Gross for [reporting this problem](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fiji-devel/g6Z2Xz2vAzY/dxGS9AULwOcJ).

milestone: 1.0.0 - Official Release
comments:
We need some thorough regression tests to confirm, but I think I did this as part of the writer fixes (and some special case fixes today)

Currently in ImgSaver, if there are N composited channels (from ImgPlus.getCompositeChannelCount()) then every N planes are composited together and passed to the writer for saving.

Tested converting (non)interleaved and (non)indexed RGB images to all of SCIFIO's writers and it all seems to be working nicely on the current master.
