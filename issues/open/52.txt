title: Improve IRandomAccess naming
body:
Remove RAIS name field
give IRandomAccess a get/setName method
Have RAF and RAIS .tostring chain up the getName method, which will be implemented in handles
can be.. toString: getname == null? return super.tostring : getname
can lock the setname method in handles that take a string/file in the constructor and just implicitly set the name on construction
