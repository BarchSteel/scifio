title: write unit tests for default classes
body:
I was looking at the Default SCIFIO component classes and their format association logic seems fragile/didn't make complete sense and I'm not sure it interacts correctly in all the FormatService API methods (e.g. registering associations between format and component).

This area should be covered by unit tests.
