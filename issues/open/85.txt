title: Make automated regression tests for each supported reader and writer
body:
I severely broke writing with the N-D conversion in 0.7.0, and didn't catch it. It is too much of a burden to manually test the combinations of reading, writing and translation, but these are critical things to have test coverage over.

So we need to establish a pixel-based test like the test-images-good tests in Bio-Formats, and I don't think we should release 0.8.0 without it.
assignee: null
milestone: 0.8.0
comments:
* first pass test:
- create a variety of fakes
- Write them using each writer
- read them back with each reader

* port the Bio-Formats test-suite component to scifio, make maven run on every compile against fakes

the comprehensive tests will be running the test suite against a scifio-compatible subset of test-images-good
