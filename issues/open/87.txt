title: Stop using ReflectedUniverse
body:
We should get rid of `ReflectedUniverse`, because:
* `ReflectedUniverse` often results in `ClassLoader` issues
* `ReflectedUniverse` code is not compile-time checked and hence harder to debug
* It is better to use a proper compile-time dependency, code the logic in an isolated class, then catch `ClassNotFoundException` in key parts of the code when the dependent code cannot be loaded.
* Or: wrap the functionality in a `SCIFIOService` with a dummy default implementation, and provide the more functional implementation in a downstream component that leans on the needed dependency properly.
