title: Enhance Handle usage
body:
Basically we want to get rid of Location mapping and re-think how Handles are used, and make them all plugins (currently just StreamHandles are plugins).

VirtualHandle was added as a intermediate solution until this ticket is resolved.

@ctrueden  - flesh this out with what you would like to see for the final Handle usage, and move it to 0.8.0 if desired.

milestone: 0.9.0
